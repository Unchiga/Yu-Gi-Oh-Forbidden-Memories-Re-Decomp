/* The loader for code mods: one 32-bit x86 ELF relocatable object (`.o`),
 * the same file on Linux and on Windows (notes/modding.md). Both builds are
 * 32-bit x86 with the same calling convention, so the machine code in a mod
 * runs on either; only the container differs, and this reads the one
 * container on both.
 *
 * Loading lays the object's allocated sections out in fresh memory, binds
 * each name it leaves undefined through `resolve` (the game's export table
 * and the host's C library, exports.h), applies its relocations, and then
 * makes the code executable and nothing else. The file is untrusted input:
 * anything malformed, and anything this loader does not do, fails with a
 * message and leaves nothing behind. What it does not do, on purpose:
 * position-independent code (a GOT), thread-local storage, COMMON symbols,
 * and constructors. tools/pc/build_mod.py builds objects without any of
 * them. */
