native PC game for Windows and Linux. Bring your own disc image; no game data is
included.

## Play

Download the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/Unchiga/Yu-Gi-Oh-Forbidden-Memories-Re-Decomp/releases),
extract it and run `memories-pc.exe` (Windows) or `./memories-pc` (Linux). On first
launch, pick your USA disc's `.bin`. For the HD pack, extract its zip next to the game.

**From source:** put the `.bin` in `game/` and run `play.bat` or `./play.sh`. The first
run builds everything (Linux needs `gcc` and `python3`). See [PC build](notes/pc-build.md).

## Decompilation

Every game function matches the original executable byte for byte:

```sh
make tools   # pinned toolchain
make match   # rebuild SLUS_014.11 exactly (see notes/setup.md)
```
