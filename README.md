# Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories Re-Decomp

> [!WARNING]
> Very much a work in progress.

A byte-matching decompilation of the North American PlayStation release of
**Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories** (`SLUS-01411`), rebuilt as a native PC game
for Linux and Windows.

No game data is included. Bring your own dump of the disc.

## Release builds

Extract the Windows ZIP or Linux tar.gz and run `memories-pc.exe` or
`./memories-pc`. The first launch welcomes you and asks you to choose your
USA disc's `.bin` ROM. Its location is remembered for future launches.

The [PC release packages workflow](.github/workflows/pc-release.yml) builds
both platforms for pull requests and updates to `master`. Version tags
(`v*`) prepare a draft GitHub release with both archives.
See [release packaging](notes/pc-release.md) for the layout and checks.

## Play from source

1. Put your disc image (the `.bin` of the USA disc, any file name) in `game/`.
2. Run `./play.sh` on Linux or `play.bat` on Windows.

The first run builds the game, fetching what it needs into `tmp/`; after that
it starts straight away. Linux needs `gcc` and `python3` installed (`play.sh`
says so if they are missing); Windows needs nothing. See
[PC build](notes/pc-build.md).

## Match the PS1 executable

```sh
make tools          # pinned toolchain, installed under tools/
make match          # rebuild the PS1 executable byte-for-byte (see notes/setup.md)
```
